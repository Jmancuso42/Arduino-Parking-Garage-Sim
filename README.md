# Embedded-C-Reference-Snips
Some Embedded C code that will be useful for reference when I get back to messing with microcontrollers



##The Keypad takes input from a 9 digit pad and converts it into the correct binary and outputs a number
 
##The seven segment takes in input and bit shifts the correct numbers to display depending on the applications
 
## The stepper motor snip has code to get the motor to turn the specified quarter of 360, or finer movements.

## USART is not my own code
