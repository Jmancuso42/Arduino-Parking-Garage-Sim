#Arduino-Parking-Garage
The middle of my Embedded C Career led to creating a parking garage on a breadboard, but I never quite got to simulating parking -tickets-...


The Keypad takes input from a 9 digit pad and converts it into the correct binary and outputs a number
 
The seven segment takes in input and bit shifts the correct numbers to display depending on the applications
 
The stepper motor snip has code to get the motor to turn the specified quarter of 360, or finer movements.

USART is not my own code

### Parking Garage:
This projeact simulated pushing a button at a gate, the gate opening, playing a noise, operating servos that would close the gate and light up a status light.
